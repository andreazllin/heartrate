### Updates

#### 6th Aug. 2022

Code for the server and client were written in Jan/Feb 2021, when I used to code in JavaScript only, instead of TypeScript.

As I wanted to try Svelte, this repository currently does not contain a frontend client.

You can find the old website code [here](https://github.com/5tsuki/heartrate-client), forked for archive.

About the server, the code will be updated to a TypeScript version some time in the future. PRs are appreciated.
